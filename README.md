# How to Write a Git Commit Message

[Read the full guide here](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#why-not-how)

I picked this article because I thought it was an appropriate time
before we began working with our respective teams for Project 1.
Here is a quick summary of the article.

Having a clear commit message is important because it improves
collaboration, project maintainability, and debugging in a project.

**A good commit mesage follows these rules:**

- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain <em>what</em> and <em>why</em> vs. <em>how</em>

In a team setting, Without a uniform convention, it is hard to make
the logs readable, and therefore, would be challanging to debug and
undestand history. Thus, it is recommended that the team's first
approach to its commit log should be to agree on a commit message
convention that defines at least the **"style," "content," and "metadata."**

I agree, this article is very appropriate for this course and I took a lot from it! I learned about git and GitHub through a research project, so the primary __"rule"__ we followed for commit messages was just writing a message that recapped what we had done. Since I didn't know how to properly utilize commit messages, I wrote long and clunky messages that were hard to follow. A lot of my previous commit message look like the before examples. I will definitely use the rules listed in the article, especially the "<em>what</em> and <em>why</em> vs. <em>how</em>" rule. I feel that it will help my teammates, and myself, better understand the evolution of our code.
